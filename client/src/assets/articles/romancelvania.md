"Jumpkin."

That was the word that made me purchase this game. My brother found this game (through _some_ bizarre means) and was telling me all about it.

"It's a game where Dracula spends one hundred years moping about a bad breakup."

"Uh huh."

"Then, his old friend the Grim Reaper leaves him a note saying they're doing poker night, but tricks him into starring in a lavish dating reality show designed to get him back in the game."

"Oh, that's really clever and funny. Neat!"

"And there's an entire pumpkin themed level where one of the enemy types is called a 'jumpkin.'"

In that moment, I knew that there was no possible way that I couldn't purchase and play this game. There are no realities that exist, no alternate universes, where I did not get this game.

And boy, howdy, am I glad I did. The premise alone is not the only good idea: this game oozes with creativity and cleverness, having surprisingly intelligent and varied jokes, goofs, and knee-slappers. But when it wants to get real and indulge some sincerity or legitimately romantic atmosphere, it succeeds, almost every time.

The star of the show, quite literally, is Dracula (or Drac, as the game calls him). You'd think that he'd sigh and drag his feet the entire game, given how the premise lays things out. However, after some teething troubles at the very start, Drac starts doing his best to play along. One of the aspects of the game is the "Black Rose," a choice that essentially votes someone "off the island," as it were. You don't like the incubus who talks like a bro? When the time is right, you give 'im the Black Rose, and he's eliminated from the show.

And Drac, despite not wanting to be a part of this show at all, and thinking the entire idea is stupid, _still_ puts effort into a heartfelt goodbye speech, even if you choose to do a short and sweet salute. He doesn't need to, but he does, because he has dignity and treats people with a base amount of respect and decorum. This is made all the funnier when you remember that it's _Dracula_ having to interact with various modern phrases and concepts, and stil behaving like an ancient Transylvanian royal. The entire premise, as well as most of the cast, are perfect character foils.

Now, from everything I've said, you're probably thinking this is some visual novel dating sim. Not the case! There are two halves of this game: one half is the visual novel dating simulator you'd expect, but the other half is a 3D, fully animated sidescrolling metroidvania.

...and the metroidvania half is easily the absolute worst part about this game.

Don't get me wrong: I'm glad it's there. It's a truly interesting and, at times, satisfying approach to this concept that elevates this game above any visual novel dating sim with a similar level of creativity and writing prowess.

But OH.

MY.

GOSH.

Is this game JANKY.

This is the gaming equivalent of a day-old sandwich. Everything's there, it _can_ taste great, but every now and then you get a hint of something that _really_ should've been looked into before eating. And it's possible that it's hiding quite a few bugs.

Several of those bugs include fatal exceptions during loading screens. I got five of those in a row at the same checkpoint. However, given my prior experience with this game's jankiness and bugs, I deduced that the workaround for this would probably be something stupid that wouldn't make sense to anyone unfamiliar with the game.

The solution?

I'd been approaching the checkpoint from the _left_ side of the screen.

When I approached it from the _right_ side, the loading screen went off without a hitch.

Another spicy bug was when I recruited a character for the dating show, left his house after he accepted and warped to the castle (your home base), and revisited his house to see if I missed anything...only to find him sitting there, like before. I talked to him and he said the same line of dialogue he'd said when I finished his quest, accepting the call to be on the show for the second time.

And to top it all off, the game interpreted him as _two_ cast members, and the quest to get all cast members was marked "Completed," despite me still having one actual npc to go.

It's also quite poorly optimized, at least on the Steam Deck. To be fair, it's not actually tested on the Steam deck, like at all. So, the fact that it worked even remotely is a plus.

But beyond the performance and bugs, the biggest gripe I have is with the combat. Little niggles constantly pile up, like how Dracula doesn't really seem to have invincibility frames after getting hit, or how Dracula runs _just_ slow enough to be annoying, or how the jumping sword attack feels like it strikes a full second after you hit the button, or how the spear _sometimes_ charges forward like it's supposed to and sometimes doesn't, etcetera. SO MANY THINGS. So many things that would be noticed almost immediately by just booting up the game yourself and going at it for half an hour.

Ninety-nine percent of the gripes I have are with the combat and the exploration, but the one percent dating sim gripe I have is that the dialogue options you get, while they have the A, B, X, and Y button prompts if you use a controller, aren't situated to directionally match those button positions. Take Fallout 4, for example. The "Y" button response prompt is always up top, "X" is always to the left, and "B" is to the right. But for this game, it's in a vertical list, with the order occasionally switching up without telling you.

And my final gripe, apart from the ending feeling _super insanely_ rushed, is that the pirate and underwater segments weren't fun. They were meh at best, irritating at worst.

Most other main areas in this game are great, though. One thing I will absolutely praise Romancelvania for is its atmosphere. It has this comfy, cozy Halloween vibe that seeps into every character interaction, with Dracula's castle as a spooky backdrop. And many of the places you go in the main map has the same undertone of "Dating Reality Show," where you'll see scaffolding and hanging lights at the top of the stages. They could've pushed this a bit further, but halfway through the game, you're told to leave the set to find new cast members. So, for the purpose of the story, it wouldn't really make sense to keep that theme going. But they could've written in a reason, dangit. The reality show and Transylvania aesthetic is just that strong.

Like I said above, I played this bad boy on the Steam Deck. It seems like a game that'd be most at home on a handheld, given the graphical level and gameplay style. That's not to say the graphics are simple or ugly: The 3D models and animations are far from awful (except the succubus character, who looks like a human pig made out of play-dough). But there's basically no emoting from these characters, and they all seem to cycle through different idle animations, moving their mouths at random when they speak and making sparse movements with their arms and legs. Additionally, though I said the models aren't simplistic, they are pushed more cartooney in style and don't have as much texture as they probably should (hence the human playdough pig).And, if you played this on a big screen, I imagine that'd only be incredibly evident.

Overall, the 3D models do whatever they need to do to get the job done. In boss fights, they can have elaborate moves, but, for the most part, they'll either stand or float there with their eyes unmoving, their mouths going off, and bodies leaning slightly inward and out to simulate breathing or posture adjustment. It's not something you really notice until you look back on it as a whole, because you're more focused on the ideas, writing, and the voice acting, three things that absolutely were _not_ skimped on. Well...when a certain character shows up and doesn't have any voice acting at all (despite the fact that they _should_), that is the one instance where they flubbed it.

Every time I wrapped up work and finished up my tasks for the day, I'd think to myself, "Oh, BOY! I get to snuggle up into this warm, light-hearted, ridiculous game about Dracula trying to find the right soul mate to fill the hole in his heart that his ex left!"
