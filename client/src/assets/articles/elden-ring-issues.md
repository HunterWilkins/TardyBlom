I own a steel chestplate. It's nothing fancy, it's lightweight, and it's thin. However, if I were punched in the chest with it on, I would barely feel a thing. Meanwhile, punch me in the chest without it on, and I'd crumple like a tower of cards.

Boy, am I glad I don't live in the Elden Ring universe, because (among other reasons), not only would this simple and effective form of self defense weigh as much as a lead dumptruck, but it would also do absolutely jack to protect me. I'd raise my weapon to attack some knee-high dog and, rather than have my attack follow through due to a little thing called "gravity," the dog would somehow defy physics when it bit me, causing my warhammer to fly upward away from it. Additionally, I would be halfway dead from the single bite it took.

Sorry, did I say "dog," as in "singular?" I meant "dogs."

A lot of them. 

And some archers one thousand miles away.

Fun fact: when I was a teeny little child, I was bitten in the face by a fully-grown Labrador. I never exercised, didn't eat a lot, and had a condition called "growth hormone deficiency," where I was significantly shorter and lighter than any other kid my age.

That dog bite did *NOT* send me halfway to my grave. It hurt a lot and wasn't particularly pleasant, but it didn't literally almost kill me.

Now, the whole "realism in video games" debate is pretty fruitless, especially in a game where you can fight dragons and, most importantly, don't need to eat or drink to not die. However, a video game's primary objective is to be fun. Most video games bend the rules of realism in order to accomplish this goal. Resonance of Fate, for example, would be horrifically boring without its "jump twenty feet in the air" mechanic. 

Elden Ring, unfortunately, bends the rules of reality away from the "fun" aspect in too many frustrating and unbelievable ways. In reality, armor defends against damage. In reality, a dog that weighs twenty-five pounds cannot interrupt an over one-hundred and sixty-pound man's swing of an axe. In reality, an enemy's arrows don't behave like heat-seeking missiles. However, in Elden Ring, these things and more are true.

Allow me to get the basic point of this article across rather than beat around the bush any more: Elden Ring is the most beautiful game I've ever played, with a creativity of design, interaction, and exploration that I haven't seen since Morrowind. However, the primary gameplay loop is so absolutely, fundamentally, *basically* broken that the ONLY way to feel like the scales are even is to literally hack into the game and change the variables yourself.

It's not just that the flaws are amateurish, it's the fact that they are so ridiculously easy to fix but From Software just *won't* fix them. No matter what armor you wear, you will still take at least sixty percent of any incoming damage and get interrupted during an attack. That is not a design choice made to balance a game evenly; it's designed specifically to kill the player. 

The fix? Give the player the correct amount of poise. Right now, the highest poise level I could get in the game without buffing is around sixty-five. Let's be generous and say that the maximum poise you can get with buffing is one hundred. Heck, let's go one hundred and fifty.

Do you know how much poise it takes to not be staggered by a level one dog? 

Twenty thousand. 

I'm not kidding. And, for the record, in case you were wondering, there is no armor set in the game that gives you twenty thousand poise.

All From would have to do is multiply the poise values of all armor sets by one thousand, and the game would be that much more balanced. Want to know how I know? Because I hacked the game to give myself a quantity of poise that worked. There is no "hasPoise" variable that's only triggered at certain times, there is no complex calculation. There's only a number, and that number is one thousand times less than it should be. It's so easy to change this value to a reasonable one, but they won't. They want the player to be interrupted constantly.

Now: this game (and all other soulslikes) have attracted roughly fourteen or fifteen middle-school-aged troglodytes that actually like the scales being tipped masochistically against the player. These kids (who have totally hot girlfriends who just donâ€™t go to this school) were the ones that didn't realize the "git gud" joke slogan was a joke, and respond to any rebalance requests with "lol just dodge" (as if you can dodge a flurry of ten attacks from three enemies) or "lol just level up" (when, at the highest level of health, you can still be pummeled in three hits). These malignant, subterranean mealworms of human beings don't actually have any points to make or brain cells to rub together, so we don't have to actually address any of the gas expulsions they refer to as "arguments." When they're done with Elden Ring, they'll go back to setting ants on fire in their back yards, throwing rocks at birds, and sitting in their rooms waiting for mommy and daddy to stop arguing, and we'll go back to our full-time jobs that we relax from by playing video games that don't waste our time.

It's also important to note that these aforementioned middle schooler troglodytes have actually never beaten a From Software game and don't know how. The closest they've ever gotten is fighting the Asylum demon in Dark Souls 1, and they quit because they couldn't kill the Asylum demon in one hit with a shotgun. Their favorite video game is Dark Souls II, the "dodge" button on their controllers has never been used, and they have blue hair and write editorials on Kotaku.

That being said, I will say this: If poise was reintroduced, if armor defended against attacks, if arrows didn't LITERALLY swerve in mid-air to hit you, absolutely nobody would complain. Not a single person wants these flaws in the game, so there can only be a positive result from addressing them. But, as I've said, From doesn't want to address them. They want to win this nonexistent fight against the player.

And that's the primary issue with all From Software games: the alpha of the "Git Gudders" is From Software itself. I used to think that From Software was misunderstood, that the lacking balance and irritating, amateurish gameplay was an accident brought upon by expanding from the Bloodborne engine rather than willful game design choices. I thought that, after making two cult classics in Demon's Souls and Dark Souls, they were struggling with the external perception that their games were meant to be hard. 

Unfortunately, I've seen [an article](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/hidetaka-miyazaki-sees-death-as-a-feature-not-a-bug) where Hidetako Miyazaki says he feels "apologetic" toward players who feel like his game is artificially unfair and has several absolutely glaring balance oversights. He doesn't apologize for the asinine gameplay, but rather seems to apologize that we're having a bad time. It's essentially the "I'm sorry you're offended" of game director responses. He notes the "difficutly" as a crucial part of his games.

So, getting killed in one hit by a boss when every other enemy has dealt a reasonable amount of damage, getting killed in one hit by an elementary magic attack when you've tanked physical hits that should've cut you in half, getting killed in one hit by a random NPC invader when their other attacks have dealt normal damage, getting killed in one hit by an enemy you weren't targeting in a boss battle because there are two bosses and only one of you, getting killed in one hit when you have an absolutely ridiculous quantity of health?

Having armor not defend against damage, getting staggered by dogs and INSECTS despite wearing the heaviest armor in the game, not being able to upgrade said armor to prevent this, having your preferred method of dealing with enemies patched out, getting stabbed for half of your health (regardless of what armor you're wearing) by an enemy that is completely invisible, fighting a boss that heals whenever it hits you, getting grabbed and being unable to break out of the attack, having shields get knocked out of your hands constantly by attack combos that last far too long, running out of magic despite enemies never running out of magic, being hit by enemies you can't reach while you're fighting other enemies, having NPC summons just not appear in certain boss fights where they're desperately needed, hiding the ability to purchase upgrade materials for starter weapon reinforcement in the final half of the game, getting killed in one hit by an enemy jumping from one side of the arena to the other in the blink of an eye, not being able to hit a boss because they keep moving, getting killed in one hit by an attack that envelops the entire arena and hits twice so you can't dodge out of it?

Getting killed because you got knocked off your horse and it takes what feels like a full minute for you to get back up, getting killed in one hit by a hidden ballista in a fortress, getting killed by TWO hidden ballistae in a fortress, getting killed by THREE hidden ballistae in a fortress, having to literally run past boss fights in certain areas in order to proceed at the level the game set you up at, getting killed by enemies that are three feet tall with pitchforks but can somehow chop off half your health despite you being a seasoned and armored warrior and them being three-foot-tall militia men wearing fabric tunics, stopping dead on your horse because an enemy fired an arrow and it lodged into your back despite physics dictating that such a thing would propel you forward, having your ashen summons get immediately killed regardless of their upgrade level and leaving you to fight a boss all alone with less magic as a result, getting killed in one hit because of a GLITCH that has (at time of writing) not been patched out after three months, being swarmed with mini-boss level enemies and somehow being expected to fight them all off despite the lock-on mechanic being suited for one-on-one combat? 

Having to fight a follow-up boss from another boss without having your healing items refilled and the game not saving the progress you've already made, being forced to wade through a poison swamp that prevents you from running and not providing you an item to subvert that, dying in a boss fight not because you're bad at the game but because your fully-upgraded weapon which has killed normal enemies in two hits now deals close to zero damage and the boss can (if you've not picked up on this by now) kill you in one hit, and having nearly all of the talismans be completely and utterly worthless, one of which literally lies about what it does?

Yup, that's all intentional. From Software intended for every single item in my paragraph above to be present in the game. That's what the Miyazaki interview told me. 

This game isn't as bad as Dark Souls 3, which was an ugly, miserable slog of spastic enemy swarms, fire archers, and fan fiction level world building. Dark Souls 3 was truly one of the worst games I've ever played. In terms of fairness and fun, Elden Ring is leagues better than Dark Souls 3 or Sekiro, a game in which I literally had to cut all enemy damage in half for it to be balanced. 

But From stubbornly, stupidly, and *intentionally* refuses to make the two fixes to its formula that would make its games fair:

1. Make poise work like in Dark Souls 1
2. Have armor defend against damage

These two bog-standard fixes have been addressed by modders three days or so after Elden Ring's release. From has no excuse.

Until they decide to create a video game rather than a series of invisible bear traps, I won't be supporting them. I realized that the From Software I loved, the one that made Dark Souls, Demon's Souls, Dark Souls 2, and Bloodborne, is no longer with us. Unless the tagline for their next game is "WE AREN'T TRYING TO KILL YOU THIS TIME, WE ACTUALLY THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT THE PLAYER CAN DO TO WIN FIGHTS RATHER THAN WHAT ENEMIES CAN DO TO KILL THE PLAYER," I'm not going to even give it a passing glance. I played a lot of Elden Ring after modding in poise, but it's too much effort to have fun with a From Software game, and that effort is only going to scale up as From doubles down on its laziness and short-sightedness. 

In order for Sekiro to be balanced, I had to cut the enemy damage in half. 

In order for Elden Ring to be balanced, I had to reintroduce poise, edit several talismans to fortify my physical damage absorption, cut magic, holy, lightning, and fire damage entirely in half, disable the death blight system (which was no better in Dark Souls 1), and literally render myself unkillable in order to get past the Godskin Duo. By the time I had that set up, I'd already beaten the game with my first character and explored all the game had to show. From Software ruined my first playthrough of this game and, as a game relying heavily on exploration, ruined every other playthrough, too.

So, I'm done with Elden Ring, and I'm done with From Software. Unless they can quench their ego and realize that catering to "git gudders" who don't have jobs, talents, deodorant, or the ability to operate heavy machinery is an incredibly stupid idea, I'm going to simply play games that want me to have fun. I'm not going to play games that were intended for someone else...that someone else being a living example that Neanderthals still roam the Earth and put all their value in how good they are at one hard video game (that they can't even beat).
