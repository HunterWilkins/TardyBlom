I own a steel chestplate. It's nothing fancy, it's lightweight, and it's thin. However, if I were punched in the chest with it on, I would barely feel a thing. Meanwhile, punch me in the chest without it on, and I'd crumple like a tower of cards.

Boy, am I glad I don't live in the Elden Ring universe because (among other reasons), not only would this simple and effective form of self defense weigh as much as a lead dumptruck, but it would also do absolutely jack to protect me. I'd raise my weapon to attack some knee-high dog and, rather than have my attack follow through due to a little thing called "gravity," the dog would somehow defy physics when it bit me, causing my warhammer to fly upward away from it. Additionally, I would be halfway dead from the single bite it took.

Sorry, did I say "dog," as in "singular?" I meant "dogs."

A lot of them. 

And some archers one thousand miles away.

Fun fact: when I was a teeny little child, I was bitten in the face by a fully-grown labrador. I never exercised, didn't eat a lot, and had a condition called "growth hormone deficiency," where I was significantly shorter and lighter than any other kid my age.

That dog bite did *NOT* send me halfway to my grave. It hurt a lot and wasn't particularly pleasant, but it didn't literally almost kill me.

Now, the whole "realism in video games" debate is pretty fruitless, especially in a game where you can fight dragons and, most importantly, don't need to eat or drink to not die. However, a video game's primary objective is to be fun. Most video games bend the rules of realism in order to accomplish this goal. Resonance of Fate, for example, would be horrifically boring without its "jump twenty feet in the air" mechanic. 

Elden Ring, unfortunately, bends the rules of reality away from the "fun" aspect in too many frustrating and unbelievable ways. In reality, armor defends against damage. In reality, a dog that weighs twenty-five pounds cannot interrupt an over one-hundred and sixty-pound man's swing of an axe. In reality, an enemy's arrows don't behave like heat-seeking missiles. However, in Elden Ring, these things and more are true.

Allow me to get the basic point of this article across rather than beat around the bush any more: Elden Ring is the most beautiful game I've ever played, with a creativity of design, interaction, and exploration that I haven't seen since Morrowind. However, the primary gameplay loop is so absolutely, fundamentally, *basically* broken that, after seventy-five hours of playing it, I have decided to stop. 

It's not just that the flaws are amateurish, it's the fact that they are so ridiculously easy to fix, but From Software just *won't* fix them. No matter what armor you wear, you will still take at least sixty percent of any incoming damage and get interrupted during an attack. That is not a design choice made to balance a game evenly; it's designed specifically to kill the player. 

The fix? Make enemies deal less poise damage. Right now, the highest poise level I could get in the game without buffing is around sixty-five. Let's be generous and say that the maximum poise you can get with buffing is one hundred. Heck, let's go one hundred and fifty.

Do you know how much poise it takes to not be staggered by a level one dog? 

Twenty thousand. 

I'm not kidding. And, for the record, in case you were wondering, there is no armor set in the game that gives you twenty thousand poise.

All From would have to do is multiply the poise values of all armor sets by one thousand, and the game would be that much more balanced. Want to know how I know? Because I hacked the game to give myself a quantity of poise that worked. There is no "hasPoise" variable that's only triggered at certain times, there is no complex calculation. There's only a number, and that number is one thousand times less than it should be. It's so easy to change this value to a reasonable one, but they won't. They want the player to be interrupted. I won't play a game that wants me to fail.

Now: this game (and all other soulslikes) have attracted roughly fourteen or fifteen middle-school-aged troglodytes that actually like the scales being tipped masochistically against the player. These neanderthals were the ones that didn't realize the "git gud" joke slogan was a joke, and respond to any rebalance requests with "lol just dodge" (as if you can dodge a flurry of ten attacks from three enemies) or "lol just level up" (when, at the highest level of health, you can still be pummeled in three hits). These malignant, subterranean mealworms of human beings don't actually have any points to make or brain cells to rub together, so we don't have to actually address any of the gas expulsions they refer to as "arguments." When they're done with Elden Ring, they'll go back to setting ants on fire in their back yards and we'll go back to our full-time jobs that we relax from by playing video games that don't waste our time.

That being said, I will say this: If poise was reintroduced, if armor defended against attacks, if arrows didn't swerve in mid-air to hit you, absolutely nobody would complain. Not a single person wants these flaws in the game, so there can only be a positive result from addressing them. But, as I've said, From doesn't want to address them. They want to win this nonexistent fight against the player.

After seventy-five hours of playing and (mostly) enjoying Elden Ring, I've decided that From won. I won't inherit the Elden Ring, I won't sit on the throne, I won't beat the game. Because I spent seventy-five hours in the game's combat system, levelling up myself and my equipment, finding out the path of maximum efficiency and effectiveness, and the final two bosses and their area-of-effect attack spamming, across-the-map attack reach, and mad flailing twenty-hit attack combos just kept killing me. I've played and beaten every single From soulslike game, and beaten what I believe is ninety percent of Elden Ring, so I *have* gotten good. But my "good" isn't good enough, apparently. I asked myself, "if my best isn't enough, then why bother?" 

So, I quit. 

I might pick it up a year from now if From decides to pull their head out and fix the game they sabotaged, or if there's a mod that addresses my complaints and *doesn't* make the game crash. But, until then, I'm throwing this game and all future From games in the trash. I'm not going to support this deevolution of a once great formula.

This game isn't as bad as Dark Souls 3, which was a miserable slog of spastic enemy swarms, fire archers, and fan fiction level world building. In terms of fairness and fun, it's leagues better than Dark Souls 3 or Sekiro, a game in which I literally had to cut all enemy damage in half for it to be balanced. But From stubbornly and stupidly refuses to make the two fixes to its formula that would make its game fair:

1. Make poise work like in Dark Souls 1
2. Have armor defend against damage

These two bog-standard fixes have been addressed by modders three days or so after Elden Ring's release. From has no excuse.

Until they decide to create a video game rather than a series of invisible bear traps, I won't be supporting them.
