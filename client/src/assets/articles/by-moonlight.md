Visual novels are a mixed bag. That bag is primarily mixed with a good-bad ratio of one to eight hundred thousand. You typically get either sad and horrifically pornographic or head-smacking-the-table boring.

However, the genre is occasionally fertile soil for a short, fun time. Not to mention a lot of them are free, and that’s what the Freebie Theatre is all about.

“By Moonlight” is a free visual novel that promises to put you in the shoes of a paranormal investigator who needs to find the head of a headless horseman before the night is through, with several interactive mechanics, including five different character routes and relationship building.

Now, I was drawn in by the premise. The actual gameplay, though, was the icing on the cake. Visual novels are the worst genre for gameplay, the worst-case scenario being that you actually have no interaction with the game. Some developers take the term, “visual novel,” too seriously. So, the fact that the developer of By Moonlight thought to add in actual mechanics was a good sign.

The actual thumbnail for the game, however, is about as bad a sign as it could be.

The artwork for the rest of the game isn’t as amateurish as this, but it’s not fantastic. In fact, let’s jump into my two main criticisms of the game (bearing in mind that I do actually like it):


![By Moonlight](../images/bymoonlight2.jpg)

First, the art is subpar at best and (sorry!) laugh-inducing at worst. The characters’ faces are flat, have Schrödinger’s noses, the line quality dips at a few points, the art style drastically changes in ways that don’t feel natural, the lighting and shading of the characters seem to have been performed with a technique in Photoshop called “dodging and burning” rather than hand-drawn shadows and lights (which essentially just looks like flat pieces of paper with dark edges rather than accurate 3D shading), and the backgrounds seem to all just be photos with the occasional white or black lines added in to try and meld the photographic with the artistic.

Second, the story feels like a first draft. It’s not explicitly poorly written, but it trips into a lot of first draft pitfalls.

The cast of characters feels like an ensemble of OCs (of the “do not steal” variety). They clearly have long, well-developed backstories and behaviors, but some of their character traits seem too “normal peopley,” for lack of a better word. The vampire girl drinks tomato juice and looks like a corpse, but her hobbies involve baking cake and having movie marathons? Why are such normal traits in this explicitly paranormal story? Why is the aforementioned character a vampire when she could have just been a random human?

The biggest flaw of the writing, however, is what I like to call, “Just Finish the Story,” syndrome. This syndrome isn’t based on what the reader is thinking; it’s based on what the author was thinking while writing the story. “I’ve spent so much time writing through each plot point,” the writer would say, “I already know how it’s going to end…ugh, I’m just going to get to the finish line.” So, the pacing is fairly lax for most of the story, but the climax and ending go by in the blink of an eye.

The story meanders around the halfway point, where it looks like your duty as a paranormal detective is over. The mystery is resolved, if not closed, and the headless horseman’s head literally tells you, “never mind.” But the plot and the remaining characters just assume you’re fine with hanging around with them, forced to be inside this mansion despite your work essentially being done.

This meandering gets thrown out the window, however, when “Just Finish the Story” syndrome sets in. Insane plot twists are thrown at the player, action scenes fly out of nowhere, and new characters and concepts get introduced in only a few lines. The player barely gets a chance to breathe within this cloud of chaotic new information. It left me with a strange aftertaste as the credits rolled.

Again, though, I don’t write articles about things I don’t like. I know that saying a visual novel doesn’t have stellar visuals or writing sounds like a deal-breaker, but hear me out.

The second-by-second writing can be immensely clever, most of the characters are likable, and you’re given enough agency in the story to actually necessitate use of the “save” and “load” features that are so frequently snubbed in this genre. There are several “game over” screens that are triggered by your actions, each with their own snarky line about how dumb you were to choose the option you did.

“Give the skeleton a hand?”

GAME OVER

“Oh no! I didn’t mean literally!”

Badum *tss*.

Speaking of drumkits, the music in this game is actually quite atmospheric, and high-quality, to boot. Whenever I see a visual novel, my first thought regarding the soundtrack is: “Oh boy. Can’t wait to hear some MIDI glockenspiel and flute.” However, the developer, writer, and artist of this game also composed the soundtrack. Talk about multiple hats! It radiates a strong Halloween vibe…despite the game having a February release date.

To top it all off, there’s actual investigative gameplay. At certain points in the story, you need to look around the room and click on things that seem off. It’s not top-shelf, groundbreaking gameplay, but it’s so standout in this genre that I feel it deserves special mention just for the effort.

The developer is a woman named Zara Sharaf, a jack-of-all-trades after my own heart, from the look of it. According to her Twitter (@sugarhyped), she’s working on a new game called “Before you Fade.” So, I’ll be looking forward to that!

I left my experience with By Moonlight with that aforementioned strange aftertaste due to its rushed and wonky ending, but I don’t regret playing it in the slightest.

“Is it the next To the Moon?”

Nope.

“Is it a Freydoon Rassouli work of art?”

Nah.

“Is it better than Doom Eternal?”

…what? It’s a totally different genre. Why’d you even ask that?

But I’ll tell you what it is: It’s (at times) a cleverly-written, hour-long romp that gives you significant interactivity for its genre, and it’s completely free. If you’re in the mood for such an experience, you should hop on over to Steam and check it out.

It’s not my place to tell you how to spend your money…so, it’s a good thing you’re watching the freebie theatre!
