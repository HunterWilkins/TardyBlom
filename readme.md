## *What does it mean? Nothing at all!*

This site is one man's attempt at being the next big media discussion sensation. 
Literature, music, art, film, video games, all mediums are fair game at *[tardyblom](tardyblom.com)*.



Typically, articles will fall under one of three categories:

### Reviews
These are exactly what they sound like: critical discussions of different media products.
This category will feature out-of-the-box concepts/premises, to avoid the obvious issues related to the saturation of media reviews on the Internet.

### Ruminations
Lectures and Theory Talk regarding the different fields I've taken part in. 

### Random
Anything's possible under the "Random" banner. This spot will be reserved for anything I find/think up/remember that interests me and doesn't necessarily fall under either the **Reviews** or **Ruminations** categories.

So, if you're in the mood to read some witticisms regarding nearly every entertainment medium under the sun, [then hop on over to tardyblom.com](tardyblom.com) today!
