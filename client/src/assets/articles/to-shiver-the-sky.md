There was once a young man who dreamed of piercing the sky and seeing what lies beyond, stepping foot into the great unknown. 

That dream never left him, not as he learned to walk, nor when he fell, no matter the fear, uncertainty, and improbability. He spent years upon years trying, failing, but most importantly, learning.

Then, the day came when the goal was not only identifiable, but attainable. And what did he do? He leapt up and took it.

That young man was called "humanity," and that's the journey *To Shiver the Sky* takes its listener on.

For those who are unaware (like I was a few weeks ago), *To Shiver the Sky* is a classical music album by composer Christopher Tin, a man I never knew existed until Amazon Music decided I'd like to hear "Hope is the thing with Feathers," a pretty good song from one of his later albums.

*To Shiver the Sky* was (and might still be) the highest-grossing Kickstarter-backed classical music project ever, and it deserves every single solitary penny that was donated to it. I cannot think of a time when music felt this powerful, this hopeful, or epic. Jonathan Coulton's "Space Doggity" accomplished a rare feat of making me cry by talking about a dog who was sent into space to die in the name of science, but that's a fairly easy task given the subject matter. *To Shiver the Sky* made me cry multiple times not by tragedy, but triumph, inciting within me the burning pride for how far humanity has come and what we've accomplished. I *devour* that kind of messaging, and it's so horribly rare these days. 

There's a good chance you reading this will listen to the album and go, "yeah, that was excellent...but tear-jerking? I don't know, man." I'd like to humbly request that you keep your tiny trap shut and let me fanboy in peace, capiche?

The opening for this article isn't just a creative writing prompt, it's legitimately the story of *To Shiver the Sky*, told through several languages, emphasizing how the urge to venture into the heavens has been a desire shared between every culture. The tracklist is as follows:

1. Sogno di Volare - "The Dream of Flight"
2. The Heavenly Kingdom
3. Daedalus and Icarus
4. The Fall
5. Astronomy
6. To the Stars
7. Oh, the Humanity
8. Courage
9. Become Death
10. The Power of the Spirit
11. We Choose to Go to the Moon

Already you can see what I mean when I frame this as a young human achieving his dreams. It all starts with the dream, *Sogno di Volare*, which is apparently also the theme song of *Civilization VI*, a rather famous strategy video game. I...don't know *why* it's the theme song for *Civilization VI*, but maybe it makes sense in the context of the game.

Then, after the dream, comes the speculation. *The Heavenly Kingdom*, the mysterious, aetherial realm overhead. The lyrics were taken from *Scivias*, the prophetic writings of Hildegard von Bingen, who had visions of heaven and the soul leaving the body. Though Hildegard was German, the lyrics are in latin, and the translation to English communicates the desire to depart from Earth and seek the heavens.

---
"Who are they that fly in the clouds? And like doves to their windows? 

It is said that they are those who, with full desire and full devotion, fly to heaven."

---
And then we get to *Daedalus and Icarus*, one of the most powerful pieces of the album, depicting the classic myth of Icarus's flight toward the sun, simultaneously painting a story of determination, strength, and fear as the threats of such endeavors come to light. 

After Icarus's failure, we're led into *The Fall*, with lyrics taken from the Divine Comedy. The song is a somber, wailing affair that starts with the (roughly) translated:

---
"People, human, to fly up, born, why, to a little wind, so fall?"

---
Though I (and google translate) can't do a particularly good job at getting the exacts here, it's clearly lamenting the seemingly impossible nature of flight, and the catastrophic results with our fledgling wings. 

But the song continues (taken straight from the Divine Comedy, and trimmed to fit what the lyrics were communicating):

---
"Rise. Conquer your panting with the soul that wins every battle if the heavy body does not weigh one down. 

There is a longer ladder that must be climbed. 

We climbed, he first, I following his steps, until on our view the beautiful lights of heaven dawned through a circular opening in the cave:

and thence we came forth to see again the stars."

---

No points go to whomever can tell me why the last verse was included. 

With the stars now in sight, we reach *Astronomy*, where the understanding of our world and the universe becomes stronger. The words are poeticized in Polish from the writings of Copernicus, who theorized that the Earth and the heavens were spheres.

And then we get to my second favorite piece of the entire album: *To the Stars*. 

Here, the story changes. With our newfound knowledge, we also have a newfound goal, one that, through advancements in science, math, and technology, *can* be reached. 

It starts with an uplifting, almost childish imaginative tone, sung by an all-women's choir in French:

---
"Man began by traveling on all fours,

and then one fine day, on his own two feet,

then by cart.

Quickly,

he built the patache and took to the sea

The day after,
left by stagecoach then by train

We go,

We go,

We're going to travel to the Moon,

We will go to the planets, we will go to the stars!

Stars!"

---
Then, the music changes.

The horns come in, determined, as if we're telling our laughing friend that we're serious, and it repeats the recounting of how man learns to walk, adding in ruminations on how we'll evolve next, slowly fading back into jovialty:

---
"We will soon establish rocket-shaped trains
in which the journey through the Earth will be made conveniently

the journey of the Earth..."

And then, our course is set:

"From the Earth to the moon!"

---
A triumphant note! 

We're back to determination, building up the chant that we've established with even further optimistic fervor:

---
"Man began by traveling on four legs,

then he continued to travel on his two feet,

advance by cart, coach, patache, and stagecoach

Today it's railways, hot air balloons, airplanes"

---
Then, the men join in, with heavy marcato brass:

---
"Tomorrow we will build lots of rockets in which it will be
soon 

the trip from the Earth to the moon!

From the Moon to the heavens, and from the heavens to the clouds, from the clouds to the Earth,

And from there, set off far into space"

---
Ending with a gentle, but determined declaration:

---
"To the stars!"

---
Lyrically, this is my absolute favorite of the whole album. The sheer joyfulness, certainty, and power with which these hopeful words are sung legitimately chokes me up. I heard this several times without knowing what the words meant, but when I translated them out of sheer curiosity, that's when the entirety of this album clicked, the whole meaning behind it, its retelling of humanity's journey as a stumbling, ever-present desire to shiver the skies. That's when I knew I had to write this article, I had to gush about it to *somebody*.

But we're not done yet. The next song is entitled, "Oh the Humanity," referencing the tragedy of the Hindenburg disaster, a dirigible that catastrophically erupted in flight. A challenge to the hopefulness and certainty that *To the Stars* established.

Immediately following, though, come the famous (and here, paraphrased) words of Amelia Earhart, in the song titled simply "Courage."

---
"Courage is the price that life exacts for granting peace

The soul that knows it not knows no release from little things

Knows not the livid loneliness of fear

Nor mountain heights where bitter joy

Can hear the sound of wings



How can life grant us boon of living

Compensate for dull, gray ugliness

And pregnant hate,

Unless we dare the soul's dominion?



Each time we make a choice, we pay with courage,

To behold the resistless day

And count it fair



Courage

Courage is the price that life exacts."

---
A gentle reassurance that, though scarred by the fear of this tragedy, we can still arise with courage.

And then there's a song called "Become Death," which, yeah, isn't that great and feels horribly out of place. Gets the general idea across, but it's not actually directly related to flight or air travel. I mean, they dropped the nuclear bomb from a plane? I guess that counts? But it's tangential at best, lowers the quality of the album at worst. Not a fan, I always skip it.

BUT!

We come to "The Power of the Spirit," a short, two-minute piece meant to build up what is coming next, from somber, legato notes, to grandiose, triumphant bombast...

To the crowning achievement:

*We Choose to Go to the Moon*.

Here, the narrative has changed. From the fantastical daydreams, to determined assertions, to the operative word of the title: We *Choose* to Go to the Moon.

It's no longer a matter of "if." We now have the means, we've done the math, and we're willing to risk it until we get there.

The lyrics are taken (and edited, slightly) from JFK's "We Choose to Go to the Moon" speech, dramatized with operatic fervor and orchestral embellishments to deliver an absolutely jaw-droppingly powerful climax to the story this album has been telling. The seed of thousands of years of human achievement and effort is now coming to fruition, and the only question left to answer is "why," a question that is *immediately* answered and discarded.

---
"Many years ago the great British explorer George Mallory,

Who was to die on Mount Everest, was asked

Why did he want to climb it?

(He said,) 'Because it's there.'

Because it's there!

Space is there!

And we're going to climb it!

*Space is there!* 

And the moon and planets are there,

*Space is there!* 

And new hopes for knowledge

And peace are there!"

---
At first, the rather blunt and modern language used in the speech feels at odds with the beauty of the music. However, just as the beginning of the album emphasizes the start of humanity's infatuation with the stars in its infancy, the modern language here emphasizes the gulf of time between then and now, exactly how long it took to achieve our journey to the moon, to the point where, after all this pining, we had only relatively recently accomplished it.

---
"*We choose to go to the moon!* 

And, therefore as we set sail,

*We choose to go to the moon!* 

We ask God's blessing

*We choose to go to the moon!* 

On the most hazardous and 

Dangerous and

Greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked!"

---
And that's what's so powerful about this whole thing: it's not just the story of our *dreams*, or *ambitions*, it's a story about how we actually *achieved* them! We did it! After so long, we broke out of our atmosphere and planted our flag on an orbiting satellite that some cultures once worshipped as a god. And *We Choose to Go to the Moon* takes that importance and hoists it high, ending the album and the age-old story with a choir singing:

---
"We choose the moon,

We choose the stars,

We choose the sky,

We choose to go!



We choose to go!

We choose to go!

We choose to

Go!"

---
As if they just *can't wait* to finally achieve their destiny!

Ohhhhh, it's so great, so intoxicatingly *powerful*. I legitimately choked up just editing this. 

And remember: if you *didn't*, and you're wondering, "what's this guy's deal," then your trap oughta be shut right about now. I don't need that cynicism. You're probably one of the guys who think the moon landing was faked.

It's also worth noting that whoever wrote the lyrics out on "genius.com" gave the final "Go" about four hundred thousand exclamation marks. This message of ambition, teamwork, and triumph is a universally appreciable one. And, I believe, a much-needed one. We live in an age where every single comedian, politician, artist, and author seems to think the world is only a single disaster away from unraveling by humanity's greasy, imperfect claws. They would have us believe that our dreams and accomplishments serve only to decorate some utterly *fictitious* future apocalyptic wasteland, which only exists in the perverted minds of those with such little ambition and courage that they can only imagine the worst.

We've always had a habit of accomplishing the impossible. Curing disease, seeing the bottom of the ocean, mass production, flying the circumference of the world, and, of course, touching the moon itself. If we as a species want to stay here for as long as humanly possible, then we need to act like we want to. The sheer optimism of *To Shiver the Sky* shouldn't be a rare treat, an island in a sea of rage-bait articles and sarcastic eye rolls. 

But, for what it's worth, it is. And what a beautiful island, eh?

If you want to take a brief vacation there, just look up "Christopher Tin - To Shiver the Sky." It's available on YouTube, Amazon Music, and I'm sure several other places. It got over two hundred thousand dollars after all; I doubt Spotify would say "You're not on the list."

Now go out there and, uh...fly to the moon or something. ACCOMPLISH YOUR DREAMS, stop sitting around! Hop to it! I know I certainly will. Let's start off the next chapter of humanity with a bang!
