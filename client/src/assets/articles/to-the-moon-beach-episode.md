Kan Gao is the best writer in the game industry.

That might come off as a bit hyperbolic. "What about the guys who made Disco Elysium? What about TellTale Games? What about Bioware? Or, rather, Old Bioware? Baldur's Gate 3 - are you *seriously* telling me that those writers aren't as good as Kan Gao?" They don't even come close. No story in the games industry has ever touched me more than a Kan Gao story. 

You might be thinking, "Who's Kan Gao?" If you are, you're in luck, because, as is boldly proclaimed above, he's the best writer in the games industry. He is the man behind "To the Moon," "Finding Paradise," and "Imposter Factory," three stories that absolutely obliterated my emotional state. 

He is also the man behind the "To the Moon Beach Episode," which hit me *hard*. Really, really, *really* hard. 

Without wishing to spoil, if you're a follower of the "To the Moon" series, *this is required playing*. It's one-hundred percent relevant to the overarching plot, and grand revelations do get made. In a sense, it's an elaborate meta joke, because the beach episode actually *isn't* just filler fluff with sexual undertones. 

I'm not going to go into the plot at all, but I will describe exactly what I like about it. If you're wanting a critical review, I'm sorry, but a few GUI overlapping issues, a lack of diagonal movement, and seemingly no controller support are all grains of sand in the wake of this story and writing. And, for what it's worth, any gameplay annoyances I had with the prior titles are completely addressed in this one. So, from a pure gameplay standpoint, it's the best of the series.

And from a writing standpoint, it's absolutely stellar. Kan Gao's writing so far in the series has repeatedly tackled the many-branching themes of loss. The protagonists are employees of a company that visits people on their deathbeds and gives them the happy endings that they never got to experience in life. They do this by artificially wiring their brains to write over their memories with falsified memories of what they wanted to happen. Like, if a man never asked his coworker out, and he's on his deathbed alone, wondering what could've been. It's a brutally bittersweet and morally complex setup that I've constantly been fearing Kan would fumble with each new release. But the games keep on getting better, and his stories keep on expanding on the themes with even heavier boxing gloves, smacking the player at different angles each time we step into the shoes of either Neil or Eva, the two scientist protagonists. 

Throughout To the Moon, Neil was my least favorite character. By Finding Paradise, I was warming up to him. With Imposter Factory, he became my favorite character. Eva, in comparison, seemed kind of bland and passive, playing the straight man to Neil's antics. Now, with Beach Episode, both he and Eva are my favorite characters. There's no one-upping - they both share the exact same spot.

Beach Episode, like its predecessors, juggles four different tones at any time: romance, humor, suspense, and tragedy. After spending three games with Kan Gao's storytelling, I think that I know what to expect during any suspense segment. "I know it'll come out rosy in the end." But it *doesn't always*, and the writing still always finds ways to subvert my expectations. He's able to make you feel exactly what you need to feel at any point in the story, and not just because the stellar soundtrack hits the sad piano notes whenever a sad thing happens. 

Like I said, I am not going to spoil anything in this story. But the ending to this one, in my opinion, is one of the best endings in game history. I mulled it over in my head - that's a heavy statement, with a lot of games vying for the top spot, including the prior games in the series. But the writing, the philosophy, the absolutely *real*, *bitter*, *heartbreaking* feelings on the screen, speak to how absolutely *real*, *bitter*, and *heartbreaking* loss truly can be. You can tell, from every word chosen, that this story, and the way the characters deal with what they're dealt, come directly from Kan Gao's heart, and the pain he, like all of us, feel when we lose someone dear to us. We've all lost someone, but he is so perfectly able to capture exactly *why* it hurts so bad, and how we as human beings process and reason with it. 

I might just be feeling it especially hard because, merely a few weeks ago, I suffered a loss in my family. So, being able to see what I was feeling, to read out the core essence of it all, so vividly, so painfully, from another character's mouth, summarizing it better than I ever could...it tore my heart out of my chest.

And the game ends in the absolute best possible way it could. Touching, bittersweet, inspired and... 

Perfect.

Thematically, narratively, and in execution - it was *perfect*. Perfect. I'll never forget it.

If you don't like crying (like I've done about three or four times while writing this), then you might be tempted to sit these games out. I'd encourage you to experience them anyway. It's not like it's a funeral march for each project - that wouldn't be half as touching. These games touch so many parts of the human experience - the laughs, the uncertainty, the mystery, the heartwarming, the inspirational, they're games that make you *feel*. Every time I play one, I get inspired to make the most out of my life. Beach Episode might just be the final straw that fully gets me off my rear and into the important things that I neglect. 

I was going to say how incredibly anticipatory I am for the final game, but something about what I played, and what people are saying...makes me think that this was it. If it was, like I said, it couldn't have ended on a better note - perfection.
