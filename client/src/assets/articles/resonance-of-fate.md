What? You’re saying I missed the boat by more than a literal decade? Well, shut up. You probably don’t even know what Resonance of Fate is. 

I’m as fond of JRPGs (Japanese Role-Playing Games) as any normal adult male is. I occasionally like to sample the genre, but I make sure to tap out before I get too used to it. You wouldn’t catch me dead recommending a JRPG on most days, unless we’re talking about Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Persona 5, Dark Souls, Fire Emblem: Three Houses…

…or Resonance of Fate.

The savvy among you will notice that most of the games I listed above barely have the genre-defining tropes most JRPGs have (excluding Xenoblade Chronicles 2, goodness me). You might be thinking to yourself, “Hmm…this guy seems pretty entry level in JRPG territory. Maybe this ‘Resonance of Fate,’ isn’t as bogged down with tropes as most.”

Well, you’re right! By my count, there are only two obviously underage women who are played for eye candy, there’s a mopey, cartoonishly evil and hyper-emotional teenage boy who every player hates but is written as if he’s sympathetic, there are so many obviously deeply-thought-out story elements but absolutely none of them are explained, it’s turn-based, delves loftily into Christian themes but doesn’t go anywhere with them, the comedy is hyper-exaggerated and borderline cartoonish, everyone looks like they stepped out of an anime, the soundtrack is unnecessarily fantastic, everything is overdesigned and…

…you know, I guess it is a stereotypical JRPG. But can it really be a true JRPG if they’re not killing God with the power of friendship? This doesn’t happen in Resonance of Fate. So, I’m going to chalk it up as “JRPG-Lite.”

Resonance of Fate is a forty-to-sixty hour game about three characters who live in a giant floating city called “Basel.” They perform odd jobs for people called Cardinals, who are the high-class aristocrats supposedly ruling over the masses in some form, but never seem to do anything. These Cardinals live in the topmost part of Basel, called “Chandelier,” and the further down Basel you go, the more slums pop up. It’s all clever and symbolic and totally, one hundred percent subtle. Barely noticed it. Eventually, the characters discover some massive secret guarded by the church and the plot goes on from there.

Right, now that you know that: the rest of the plot doesn’t matter. Don’t try to pay painstaking attention during cutscenes. You won’t get much. 

For reference, the first cutscene shows two of the main characters falling to their deaths. You’d think it’d be a, “Now, I know what you’re thinking: ‘Who’s this devilishly handsome fellow falling from the sky?’” moment, but, instead, the screen fades to black and says, “One Year Later.” And they NEVER explain how they didn’t die. They barely mention the events of the opening cutscene at all. 

There might’ve been an element of “lost in translation,” here and there, but most of the expository dialogue is written incredibly vaguely, as if it’s building up to a grand reveal. After playing through this game twice, I still cannot remember what this grand reveal is. If you’re like me, though, and you have a superhuman brain, you probably figured out from the beginning that the church is going to be evil. It’s a video game set in a non-fantasy setting. The church is going to end up being the bad guy.

What does matter is what sets the game apart: its setting and gameplay. The setting is steampunk and well-thought-out, giving the game a unique atmosphere. For example: one of my favorite areas in the game is a section of Basel which suffered a catastrophic malfunction and froze over. The Cardinals use this area to store food and drink. That kind of plot-setting synchronicity is borderline unmatched in the video game medium. 

But now, we get to the gameplay: the ripest and juiciest fruit on the tree.

So, each turn, you have a specific time limit where you can either move, shoot…or…FLY THROUGH THE AIR AND RAIN A HAIL OF BULLETS DOWN AT YOUR ENEMIES! You control one of the three characters at a time, and you have the option to press what I call the “action button” (X on Xbox, square on PS3, etc.) to aim your character down a line. Upon pressing the action button again, your character will run down that line and you have the option to leap up at any time. When prompted during this sequence, your character will empty his or her magazine at the selected target until the leap is over. You can fly over an entire arena, firing your guns with gratuitously stylish animations before landing on the other end of your enemy, untouched.

The best part? There is no in-game explanation for how the characters can jump over fifteen cars. The creators were just like, “it’s anime, that’s what they do.”

My only gripes with the gameplay involve the little things that pile up. For example: to level up your characters, you need to switch out their weapon types between the three available. There are handguns, machine guns, and grenades. Some characters are automatically better suited to one over the others. You have to switch around the entire party’s equipment in order to most effectively level up, and that means having your group’s weapon skills be completely under-leveled for a certain amount of time.

To put it into perspective, it’s like if an Elder Scrolls game had only three skills, and you can only use two at a time, and you can’t switch out the ones you’re using during combat. Now, imagine that you’re also controlling three characters and enemy AI typically gets aggressive toward the one with the lowest level. Also, while you’re imagining that, tack on the fact that healing isn’t a skill. So, during any mission, you have to choose one character to hold the healing item box, essentially making sure they’re the ones who need to level up the least and switching that role around as the other characters’ levels catch up. It’s like a sixty-hour race, where you’re trying to get all three participants to cross the finish line at the exact same time, but they start at different points on the track and run at different speeds.

It wouldn’t be so bad if there wasn’t an arbitrary weight limit and each character could carry everything at once. Every game would be great if all game developers decided that over encumbrance has never made a game better.

All of the above are annoying tidbits, along with a few niggles with combat, saving, and weapon customization.

What’s borderline obnoxious, however, is the fact that, if you run out of health enough times, you’ll enter something called “Condition Critical.” At this point, you lose your ability to run and leap like an anime guy and be forced to slowly plink away (completely vulnerably) at an enemy’s health bar. In a game where your health only truly goes down during this mode and where actual healing items are ridiculously rare, this ain’t a fun addition. It’s worth noting, though, that you won’t run into this often while playing and, if you do, you’re probably under-leveled for that area.

My final issue, but certainly not the least of them, is the treatment of the female member of your team. This is actually the only thing in the game I’d consider a significant barrier to entry.

Now, when dealing with JRPGs, you occasionally get some…questionable behavior toward girls who…don’t seem quite old enough. You could tell me that Leanne (the girl in question) is eighteen until the piggies go “week, week, week,” all the way home. But her voice, animations, face, and general attitude are unambiguously blaring the words, “FOURTEEN AT MOST,” across the screen at all times.

And that’s fine!

That’s totally fine.

A lot of games have kiddos and teens in them. 

The issue only occurs when characters repeatedly, throughout the course of the game, treat her like eye candy and play up her…blech…”innocence.” 

I’m not a fan of how she cries when being admired by an old, eccentric artist.

I’m not a fan of how she cries when the flamboyant bartender (it was 2010, give ‘em a break) jokes about her kissing him.

I’m not a fan of how she’s ogled by a young, eccentric artist (yeah, there are two eccentric artists).

It’s not just that these things happen, but that she’s clearly uncomfortable with it all. 

In the original draft for this article, I said, “But these moments are few and far between.” However, I recently replayed a few chapters and...no, these uncomfortable moments happen a LOT. You’re almost certain to have at least one “Creep on Leanne” moment in each chapter. So, if you don’t have a high tolerance for discomfort, I highly recommend skipping any cutscene where the camera lingers on Leanne for more than two seconds.

In spite of that, the second-by-second, minute-by-minute gameplay is so rock solid and satisfying that I would easily recommend this game to anyone who enjoys turn-based strategy…or even anyone who just enjoys having fun. There are a few gameplay sections that can go fall in a ditch, like the mannequin forest. Other than that, though, it’s almost always a hit.

I’ve listed quite a few negative things about this game and a handful of positives. The reason it seems so tilted in favor of the negative is because the positive aspects are so intricately detailed that it’s difficult to discuss them all at once. I haven’t even scratched the surface of the combat system and what makes it so rewarding. What makes this such a satisfying game is a combination of all the strange UI, sound effects, controller feedback, and animations during combat. Couple that with several strong character moments and some solid comedy, and you have a quality game that I think you’ll enjoy.

The primary reason I decided to talk about this game out of all the other random 2010-era, mid-shelf games, is because nobody else has made a game with these mechanics. It’s some of the best turn-based gameplay I’ve seen, and nobody else has stepped up to the plate to try their hand.

I thought I heard something about there being a Resonance of Fate 2 in the mix, but I mistook it for the Dragon’s Dogma 2 leak. I bring this up, though, because, while I was looking up the validity of Resonance of Fate 2, I found out that there was a remastered version released for PS4 and Steam in 2018!

WHY DIDN’T ANYONE TELL ME?!

I grabbed that remastered release almost as soon as I saw it! The only problem I have with the remaster is the occasional framerate dip, but it’s a framerate dip from a typical sixty fps. 

I’m not here to tell you how to spend your money. I just wanted to dig up this old gem for y’all because, despite there apparently being a recent remaster, the only people I know who’ve heard of this game are all in my immediate family. So, if this sounds up your alley, then look into it and see if it’s something you wouldn’t mind dropping (at time of writing) thirty-five bucks on!
