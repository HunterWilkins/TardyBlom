Shallow doesn’t mean bad. I love fine art, but, by itself, it suffers from its simplicity.

I’m not going to backtrack on that either by saying, “but its simplicity is also its strongest point.” It’s not. 

For a piece of art to be deep, it needs to stimulate thought. The most important way to burrow the piece into a viewer’s mind is to include formal detail, and detail is the most time-consuming and difficult concept to portray. The most efficient method of visual communication is literature. However, while an artist can easily write down what the art is trying to get across, this action changes the piece from fine art to something else (comics, for example). 

So, fine artists, creators of art in its purest form, must steer the viewer indirectly through the visual information using form, composition, lighting, detail, contrast, and more. This might sound overcomplicated, but, if you’ve ever seen a painting, you’ve seen this done. Otherwise, you’d be looking at a book. 

The masterworks of old are stunning. Hubert Robert, Albert Bierstadt, Rembrandt, these and more portray their subjects with splendor. But, as much as I enjoy them, there’s only so deep an image can go from a literal, formal perspective. Even with all the detail in the world (photographs come to mind), the visual information is literally right in front of your eyes. A mostly realistic, relatable piece of art communicates its concept within five to seven seconds of viewing.  

For example: Albert Bierstadt’s “Storm in the Rocky Mountains.”

![Storm in the Rocky Mountains](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Albert_Bierstadt_-_A_Storm_in_the_Rocky_Mountains%2C_Mt._Rosalie_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/1280px-Albert_Bierstadt_-_A_Storm_in_the_Rocky_Mountains%2C_Mt._Rosalie_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)

This is a genuine masterpiece, frequently lauded as Bierstadt’s magnum opus. However, even with the impressive craftsmanship, composition, lighting, and use of color, I look at it and immediately think: Mountains. From a purely literal and formal perspective, the image’s visual experience can be summed up as “a mountain range.” 

It’s a gorgeous mountain range, and its rendering draws me in and makes me comb over every inch to see what I might be missing. However, no matter what angle I look at it from, what mood I’m in, what point I focus on, it’ll still be cemented firmly in my mind as “a mountain range.”

Several fantastic spots on the painting trigger the imagination and draw me in. So, I’m hesitant to call it “shallow.” But the microscopic restraint of adhering to the real world as a setting makes this piece ever so slightly more conceptually limiting than others. 

So, if you have an overabundance of detail and put enough weight on realism, you only achieve a comparatively short bout of thought in the viewer after strenuous and time-consuming work . However, if you don’t have enough detail, you communicate nothing (hence minimalism and abstract expressionism).

My theory is this: there should be just enough realistic detail to pique the viewer’s interest and associate the abstraction of the piece with a relatable human element. If an artist achieves this, the artwork sprouts something rare, something every single artist yearns for: complete audience engagement.

Art is similar to literature in this sense: A good writer doesn’t write out every single detail in a scene. Rather, he writes in such a way that engages the reader’s imagination. He chooses which details to include and which to leave to the imagination. If a writer describes the protagonist as a bearded man, then that’s one image. If he leaves the protagonist’s appearance vague, the reader can imagine anything under the sun.

With art, rather than leave a figure without form (an impossible feat), the artist can simply leave the scene or concept vague. If you paint a picture of an exorcism and communicate that entirely, the audience sees one thing: the exorcism. However, blur the lines just enough, and the result can exercise a viewer’s mind for ages. The viewer can end up asking “what’s this?” without that being a failing on the artist’s part.

For this reason, Freydoon Rassouli is my favorite artist. Look at this image.

The mark of a masterwork is its ability to plant seeds of thoughts from questions the viewer wants to answer. A viewer might ask “Is that an angel?” internally. This could go two ways: First, the viewer’s distaste for the work turns the question into a barrier to entry, giving up on the art piece. Secondly (the preferable option), the viewer is fascinated by the question and, seeing no straight answer, creates his or her own or passes it by for a different question.

Potentially filtering out your audience is an obviously risky endeavor. However, you can mitigate this risk by following a simple rule:

Make your art look good.

There are different ways to make art “look good,” and people have been debating what “good art” is for at least a handful of decades. I’ll delve into that in a possible future article, as that’s not the topic of this piece. I will say, however, that the question of “What is this supposed to be?” aimed at the entire painting itself is the absolute worst-case scenario . You never want an audience to have to rely on the title card to explain the image, like some visual riddle. 

To deepen the viewing experience for your audience, it’s imperative that you tap into the deepest resource known to man: the human imagination. Leave just enough detail to communicate and hint at some relatability and leave the rest to them. This provides not only a viewing experience that can extend indefinitely, but also one wholly unique to the viewer.
